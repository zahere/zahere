### Zaher | AI Infrastructure Architect

**Founder & CTO at [AgentiCraft](https://agenticraft.ai)**

I build the infrastructure layer for the next generation of AI. My focus is bridging the gap between raw LLM APIs and production-grade, multi-agent ecosystems.

* **200+** Integration Patterns
* **40+** Mesh Services
* **18** LLM Providers
* **Zero-Trust** Security Architecture

---

### What I'm Building
**[AgentiCraft](https://agenticraft.ai)** — The enterprise service mesh for AI agents.
> *From pilot to production in weeks, not months.*

We are solving the hard problems in AI orchestration:
* Stateful multi-agent coordination with formal verification
* Distributed consensus for autonomous agent teams
* Deterministic workflows for non-deterministic models
* Defense-in-depth security with cryptographic identity

---

### Deep Technical Areas
* **Formal Methods** — Provable correctness guarantees for multi-agent systems
* **Distributed Systems** — Consensus, fault tolerance, service mesh architecture
* **Optimization** — Swarm intelligence, constraint programming, game-theoretic attribution
* **Protocol Design** — Open standards for agent interoperability and discovery
* **Research** — Statistical rigor, hypothesis-driven experimentation, multi-agent benchmarks

---

### Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python, Go, Rust
* **AI/ML:** LLM Orchestration, Vector Databases, RAG Pipelines
* **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Service Mesh, Distributed Systems
